# Stock Prediction App

A machine learning–powered web application for predicting future stock prices using historical data. Built with Python, Streamlit, and LSTM neural networks, this app fetches financial data, preprocesses it, trains a sequence model, and visualizes forecasts in an interactive dashboard.

## Features

- **Data Fetching**: Retrieves historical stock data from public APIs.
- **Preprocessing**: Cleans and scales data for model training.
- **LSTM Model**: Uses a pre-trained LSTM to forecast stock prices.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Streamlit UI to select symbols, view past trends, and see predictions.
- **Testing**: Unit tests for data pipeline, model integrity, and end-to-end workflow.
